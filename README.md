👋 *About Me*
I'm an engineering student passionate about building intelligent systems and working at the intersection of software and hardware. My interests lie in exploring deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I’m also interested in developing efficient, low-level code for microcontrollers and integrating smart hardware solutions. I am currently learning and experimenting with platforms like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Arduino.
I enjoy solving real-world problems using a combination of software engineering and electronics.
